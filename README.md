### Message from Thiago Ferrari
This boilerplate brings all the necessary files for running and testing the program.
The only file I edited was the "time_calculator.py" where I wrote the python program following the instructions stated on freeCodeCamp.org link mentioned above.  

The file main.py imports the "time_calculator.py" to be exceuted. It also starts the test_module.py - where I could check whether or not I met all of the project's requirements.
